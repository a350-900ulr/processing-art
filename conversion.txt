Guide on how to convert from Python files to Java.

The original CSCI 203 class was held in Python by running scripts directly in the Processing editor. All of the scripts from the class have been converted to be able to run standalone natively. Furthermore, additional features are only available natively. This only exists for my own personal reference & is not needed to run any files.

1) paste code inside generated class header (move them imports ouuuut)
2) add to top
	import processing.core.PApplet;
3) add to class header
	extends PApplet
4) add inside class
	public static void main(String...a) {
		PApplet.main(Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace()[1].getClassName());
	}
5) replace
	void setup() {
   with
	public void settings() {
6) make draw() public
